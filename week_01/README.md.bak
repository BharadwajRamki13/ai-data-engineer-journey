1. Why do engineers use git?
    - Engineers use git to track changes in code over time, collaborate safely with others , and recover previous versions when something breaks.
    - Git allows teams to work in parallel without overwriting each others work and provides a history of why and when changes were made.
Key idea: Git is for control, collaboration and recovery.


2. Script Vs Notebook - When to use each?
	Scripts:
	- Used for production system, automation and scheduled jobs because they are reproducible, testable and easy to deploy.

	Notebook:
	- Used for exploration, experimentation and analysis because they allow step by step execution and visualization.

	Exploration - Notebook
	Production  - Script 

3. Why version control matters in datapipelines?
	Pipeline changes frequently due to schema updates, logic fixes and performance improvements .
	Git allows engineers to track what changes, roll back broken pipelines , audit data transformations and ensure reproducibility across environments.
